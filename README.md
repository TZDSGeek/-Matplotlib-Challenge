# -Matplotlib-Challenge

I was able to complete the majority of this assignment by just referencing the content that was taught in the course. However, I recieve guidance from a tutor, utilized ASKBCS for troubleshooting, and referred to a past example of this assignment to ensure that I was on the right track. I also referred to the pandas documentation and stack overflow for basic troubleshooting and code suggestions.
